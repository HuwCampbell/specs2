 * 
 * It has:
 *
 *  - accumulation, with an initial state, of type S, a fold action and an action to perform with the last state
 *  
 *  - side-effects with a Sink[Task, (T, S)] to write to a file for example, using the current element in the Process
 *    and the current accumulated state
 *
 * This covers many of the needs of iterating over a Scalaz stream and is composable because there is a Monoid
